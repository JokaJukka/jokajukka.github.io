  Moikka!


  Call me ~Miroslav~ ~Mirek~ Míra. I'm passionate about open-source software, Finnish culture, and good food.


  From an early age I've been drawn to technology and science. I first immersed myself in physics during elementary school, then shifted my focus to computers and technology in high school. And these interests are still both my hobbies, but also my work.
