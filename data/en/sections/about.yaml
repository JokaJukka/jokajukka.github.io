  Moikka!


  I'm Miroslav Jarý — most people call me Míra. I'm passionate about open-source software, Finnish culture, and good food.


  From an early age I've been drawn to technology and science. I first immersed myself in physics during elementary school, then shifted my focus to computers and technology in high school — interests that still drive me today.
