# Moikka!
Welcome to my website! It's a humble place - but I've always wanted a personal space,
where I could collect not only my thoughts, but also my (in)achievements, and record my passage through the world.

Something about me - after graduating from [Jiráskovo gymnázium in Náchod](https://www.gymnachod.cz/) I decided to start my bachelor's degree
at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the Czech Technical University in Prague. I am currently working at
my bachelor thesis, which is also one of my [projects](/en/projects). I am a fan of open source applications,
Finnish language and tasty food.

I have been interested in technology and science since I was young - first in physics, which I've focused on mostly on
secondary school, and then computers and technology, which I got into in high school. Both passions
have stayed with me to this day. I still pursue physics through organizing [Výfuk](https://vyfuk.org), and technology follows me through
the rest of my life, not only in my free time but also in my studies.
