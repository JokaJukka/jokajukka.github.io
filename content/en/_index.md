# Moikka!
Welcome to my website! It's a humble place - but I've always wanted a personal space, where I could collect not only my thoughts, but also my (in)achievements, and record my passage through the world.

A little bit about me - after graduating from [Jiráskovo gymnázium Náchod](https://www.gymnachod.cz/) I decided to start my bachelor studies at [CTU FEE](https://fel.cvut.cz), which I recently [successfully completed](http://hdl.handle.net/10467/108647). Currently I am going to continue my studies at the faculty with a master's degree. I am a fan of open source applications, Finnish language and tasty food.

I have been interested in technology and science since I was young - first in physics, which I've focused on mostly on secondary school, and then computers and technology, which I got into in high school. Both passions have stayed with me to this day. I still pursue physics through organizing [Výfuk](https://vyfuk.org), and technology follows me through the rest of my life, not only in my free time but also in my studies.

Feel free to get in touch with me via any of the networks above.
